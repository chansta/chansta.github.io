<h2 id="what-bother">What bother?</h2>

<p>It is certainly true that modern econometric software, such as STATA and Eviews, are powerful tools for econometric analysis. The power of these tools centers around the fact that virtually all popular econometric routines, no matter how complicated or sophasticated, are reduced into a sequence of simple “point and click” procedures or a few lines of relatively simple commands. The ability of conducting econometric analysis without any knowledge of programming certainly has its own appeals. After all, why should a non-programmer learn programming?</p>

<p>There are few good reasons why econometricians, and to some extend, applied economists should have programming skills.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Automation: Mordern analysis often require multiple analyses on the same dataset, or same analysis on multiple datasets. Rather than conducting the analysis by typing the same commands over and over again, it is certainly more efficient to create a simple script to automate any repetitive tasks. <em>Automation</em> requires programming skills.</li>
  <li>Progress of econometrics is often faster than the software update cycles. Relying on pre-programmed routines in your favorite software means that you ability to access the latest econometric techniqes is limited. The ability to program means that you can implement the latest econometric techniques without having to wait for the software update.</li>
  <li>The popularity of econometric techniques seems to be directly related to their accessibilities. Ironically, end-users of new techniques do not generally want to do programming. Thus, if you want to promote your new techniques, chances are, you will have to program it yourself and make it publically available.</li>
  <li>Monte Carlo experiements are often expected in econometric research. Some of these experiements are computationally extensive but good background in programming can often help to improve computation efficiency. 
These arguments generally point to (i) if you are an end-user, programming skills will make your life easier by providing the ability of automating repetitive task; (ii) if you are an econometrician, then programming is a <strong>must</strong> have skills.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even if you found the arguments above convincing, the reality of leanring programming can be a challenging to those who have never programmed before. Then, of course, there is this seemingly important question, which language? Surely you do not want to learn one language only to find out it is not sufficient and have to learn something else.</p>

<p>The bad news is that programming language(s) is a little like the latest technology. There are always better, newer alternatives.</p>
