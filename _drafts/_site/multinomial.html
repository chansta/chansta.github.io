<p>Consider the multinomial expansion:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left ( \sum^n_{i=1} x_i \right )^k = \sum_{k_1=0}^k \ldots \sum_{k_{n-1}=0}^{k_{n-2}} \left [ \frac{k!}{\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} k_i!} \prod ^n_{i=1} x_i^{\Delta k_i} \right ]</script>

<p>where \( \Delta k_i = k_{i+1} - k_i \) with \( k_0 = k \) and \( k_n = 0 \).</p>

<p>Note that</p>

<p>\[ \frac{k!}{\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} k_i!} \]</p>

<p>represents the number of repeatitions of the term \( \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{\Delta k_i} \) for a given tuple  \( \left ( \Delta k_1, \ldots, \Delta k_n \right ) \).</p>

<p>An example may help to demonstrate this. Set \( n=2 \) then this is simply the binomial expansion. That is,</p>

<p>\[ \left ( x_1 + x_2 \right )^k = \sum^k_{i=0} \frac{k!}{i! (k-i)!} x_1^i x_2^{k-i} \]</p>

<p>Note that the exponents of both terms on the right hand side form a set of tuples \( (i, k-i ) \) for \( i = 0,\ldots k \).</p>

<p>Assuming we are interested in generating all the unique terms on the right hand side. That is, we are interested in generating all the tuples \( \left ( \Delta k_1, \ldots, \Delta k_n \right ) \).</p>

<p>The problem is relatively straightforward to solve for any given \( k \) and \( n \) using mulitple “for” loops. The code below shows the solution for \( k=4 \) with with \( n = 4 \).</p>

<p>However, the value of \( k \) dictates the number of loops required. This makes it difficult to allow user-specified \( k \). A more flexible way to accommodate user-specified \( k \) is</p>

<p>Note that this is a mixed of “for” loop and recursion. Or</p>
