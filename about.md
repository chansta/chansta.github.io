My name is Felix and I am an [econometrician][define_me]. Officially I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Economics and Finance][school] at [Curtin University][curtin]. My research concerns mostly on theoretical and applied econometrics but my passion is the promotion of computational econometrics through open source software. 

This passion is an result of the most frequently asked questions by students, namely, 

*which econometrics software should I use?* 

While software such as [Eviews][eviews] and [STATA][stata] provide very powerful tools for econometric analysis, I maintain the best way to learn econometrics is to implement various econometric techniques in computers. This is in the same spirit as the old wisdom that *the best way to test your understanding about something, is trying to explain that to someone else*. In other words, one can perhaps take some comfort in his/her understanding on certain econometric concepts, if he/she can instruct the computer to conduct the exact econometric analysis.

The open source community provided a wide range of platforms to make this learning exercise a complete joy. Apart the statistical orientated languages such as [R][R], languages such as [Python][python] and [Julia][julia] provide powerful and cost effective platforms for poor PhD students to consolidate and expand their econometric knowledge. 

While I have a slight preference towards Python and C with the assistant of the [GSL][gsl] library, I am hoping this blog serves a useful purpose for students and professionals to join and discuss programming issues concerning econometric problems.
