First Post and Welcome
======================

This is my first post using Jekyll and welcome to my site. For those who are interested in my old codes, they still live in my [old site][old_site] at [FreeShell][freeshell]. 

As mentioned in [About Me][about], the purpose of this site is to share my coding experiences as an econometrician. As such, most of my programming problems arise from my attempts to code certin econometric and/or statistical procedures, most likely in Python and/or C. 

However, my first post is to express my deepest gratitude to [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Github][github] which make this blog possible. I would also like to thank [Andrea Bedini][andrea] who pointed me to the right direction that is Jekyll+github. 

The migration from github to gitlab is a natural one since MS....
